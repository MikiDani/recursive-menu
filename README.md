# RECURSIVE MENU By MikiDani

This is a recursive menu builder. The menu is stored in a variable. This will convert the array to elements. When saving later, the elements are converted back into an array. If required, this variable is stored in the mySQL database. Use it if you can use it in your own project.

### IT CAN BE USED BOTH WITH A DATABASE AND STATICALLY.

If you use a database, you can set the connection data in "connect.php". Create a "menutable" database in phpMyAdmin. If you are not interested in saving to the database, you are only interested in the method, then you can also use the code statically. All you have to do is set the "enableDatabase" variable to false at the top of main.js.

CSS, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS, jQuery, PHP, MySQL
